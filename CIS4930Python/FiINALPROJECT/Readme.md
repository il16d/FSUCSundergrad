## Flappy Bird AI 
### With the possibility to have an actual player 
## -----------------------------------------------------
Was able to acomplish the replication of the famous game Flappy Bird AI and the player version.
The AI uses the NEAT algorithm 

### Instalation:
For the NEATflappy folder I used python3 to develop, a good way to get it to run is by using pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python 3) and then simply python3 FBAI.py
For the PLAYERflappy folder I used python2 to develop. The only thing you need is pygame for that so if you install the NEATflappy PLAYERflappy should be able to run without problems by just typing python3 flappy.py. or python flappy.py.
