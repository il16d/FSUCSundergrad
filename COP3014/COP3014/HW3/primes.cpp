/*  * Assignment: Homework 3 ( primes)
 * Due date: Feb 19th 2018 (late turn in)
 * About this project: This project is able to print all the prime numbers up to a given limit .
 * Assumptions: This program assumes that only positive ints are going to be entered if not then the program exites.
 * All work below was performed by Iho LÃ³pez.
