/*  * Assignment: Homework 3 ( letters)
 * Due date: Feb 19th 2018 (late turn in)
 * About this project: This project is able to print letters (J,E,C on the form of ASCR2 art)
 * Assumptions: This program assumes that no doubles are entered, other than thaht this program
 * makes sure that if the user enters a letter other than J,C or E the program keeps asking for a correct input.
 * Same happens with the size, if the size is not an even number greater or equal to 7 the program will not continue.
 * All work below was performed by Iho LÃ³pez.
