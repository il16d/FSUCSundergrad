/*  * Assignment: Homework 6 ( palcheck)
 * Due date: April 4rth 2018
 * About this project: This project is able to print take in a sentence stored in a character array(C-strin) and look for
 * sentences that read the same forward and backwards
 * Assumptions: This program assumes nothing.
 * All work below was performed by Iho LÃ³pez.
