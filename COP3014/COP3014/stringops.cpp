/*  * Assignment: Homework 6 ( stringops)
 * Due date: April 4rth 2018 (late turn in)
 * About this project: This project is able to print take in a sentence stored in a character array(C-strin) and look for
 * punctuation within the sentence, count the amount of vowels, count how many words were on the sentence and even find
 * the word you within the array.
 * Assumptions: This program assumes nothing.
 * All work below was performed by Iho LÃ³pez.
