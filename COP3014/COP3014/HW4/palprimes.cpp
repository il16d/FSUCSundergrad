/* Assignment: Homework 4 ( palindrome primes)
 * Due date: March 2nd 2018
 * About this project: This project is able to look for the palindrome primes up to a given limit.
 * for this project we reused the same program we used to look for prime numbers adding the function used to reverse numbers and one more condition to look for palindrome primes.
 * Assumptions: No assumptions are made for this program. This program will terminate if a negative value or 0 is entered
 * All work below was performed by Iho LÃ³pez.
