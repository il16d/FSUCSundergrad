/* Assignment: Homework 4 ( evaluator)
 * Due date: March 2nd 2018
 * About this project: This project is able to compute taylor series expansion by taking two numbers from the user.
 * Assumptions: This program assumes that no negative numbers are going to be entered
 * All work below was performed by Iho LÃ³pez.
