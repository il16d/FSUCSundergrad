/* Assignment: Homework 4 ( special difference)
 * Due date: March 2nd 2018
 * About this project: This project is able to compute the special difference of a number and keep track of the sum of all the numbers and their differences.
 * Assumptions: This program assumes that 0 is entered to make the recording of numbers stop. If the difference of a number is negative, the program takes care of it by turning the number positive.
 * All work below was performed by Iho LÃ³pez.

    while (x > 0) { //if x=0 then stop

        //We need to take the absolute value of the difference because the difference of a number reversed can return a negative number.
             sum = abs(difference(x))+sum; //Sum keeps track of all the differences of the numbers entered and adds them up.

            cin >> x;

//To reverse a number we ned to take the number and multiply it by ten and then add the remainder of the number when divided by 10.

            num = num / 10;
        }
        return rev_num;
    }
//The difference is done by taking the number entered, reverse it and subtracting the number entered.
    int difference(int x) {

        x = (reverse(x) - x);
