# COP3330
Some of the code for the COP3330 both from Myers and Lacher
Some of the projects I did during my undergrad at FSU, these are used to showcase my skills not for cheating at all, please discuss with your teacher if it is okay for you to borrow this code and make sure you cite it in case that you do decide to use this code so that you avoid academic dishonesty.
