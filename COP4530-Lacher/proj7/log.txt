      Coppied over required docs and began creating bfsurvey.h per instructions

April 7th, 2017
      Created dfsurvey.h aswell as fdfsurvey_dg.cpp, fdfsurvey_dg.cpp,
      fbfsurvey_dg.cpp, fbfsurvey_ug.cpp.  rebuilt makefile and graph.h with no
      implmentations only the declarations and the template headers in order to
      make sure that my organzation is correct. I attempted to compile but I
      keep getting an error in regards to a reference g_ not bound to a value,
      failure to initialize. 

April 10th, 2017:
      Still unable to fix the reference g_ error so for now I focused on the
      implmentation that of graph.h that is supplied in the graph notes.  I
      found the graph notes a bit hard to understand and would love to see a 
      lecture on the subject for better comprehnsion.  I turned to you youtube 
      to better understand the logic and overall picture in order to implment
      AddEdge(), Clear(), Reverse(), InDegree(), OutDegree(), and VrtxSize().
      I figured VrtxSize() is pretty simple because it just returns al_vector
      size using the vector Size() function, SetVrtxSize is similar again just
      use the vector SetSize() method.  AddEdge is a bit more trickey because
      you have to add both from and to vector at the same time so just took a
      minute to think about it and break it down, and I decided to use the
      vector PushBack() method but I suppose Insert() would work just aswell.  I
      am still unable to compile due ot my reference issue but in the mean time
      I am testing graph.h using fgraph.x  So I am compiling just Dump is not
      displaying my graph properly.

April 13th:
      I think my Dump method is not displaying properly because I have yet to
      implment the ALD constructors which is a bit confusing to me right now
      because a_ is a protected data member of ALU but is not able to be used by
      ALD directly.  I feel there is an easy soultion to this but I currently do
      not know.  In regards to my previous error when trying to compile using bf
      and df survey.h the issue was that my private variables needed to be
      listed before the function delcarations because many of the declarations
      also had implmentations already, so they were unable to reference the data
      members.

April 15th:
      Making a bunch of progress now thanks to Dr.Lacher hinting that I can call
      ALU constructor inside ALD's constructor, once I fixed that issue Dump()
      is working great.  However Reverse is still not.  I am stuck right now
      on Reverse because I first clear() d and than I set the size of d vector 
      I loop through using a for loop but there must be a inner loop in order to
      complete the reverse but I am not sure how to logically code it.  Going to
      think about it.  Everything else is working great and passing all tests on
      my end.  I had a hicup in bf and df search not printing the conque & constack
      properly but that was because I overlooked the instructions and failed to
      add the provided traceQue to Search() funtions but that was a easy fix

April 16th:
      Last think needed is Reverse() inside my graph.h and I began playing
      around with a AdjIterator and experimenting but I eventually got it the
      trick was realizing I can just use d.AddEdge() and pass it the loop
      variables but also derefrencing the AdjIterator inside of d.AddEdge()    
      I am currently passing all tests and gradebot is showing nodiff!
      Happy Easter.
