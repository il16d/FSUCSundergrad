February 7th:
	 Coppied over all files per instructions, read over instructions and
	 begun planning on how to tackle this assignment.

February 8th:
	 Created wordsmith.h, and wordsmith.cpp, aswell as makefile with no
	 implmentation in order to make sure all the inlcudes were correct in
	 order to compile.  Readtext() seems like the meat and potatoes of the entire program, and
	 trying to figure out how to insert into the set without errors

February 10th-13th:
	 Took 3 days to figure out why I was unable to insert into the vector
	 and why it kept throwing errors, the errors were because insert() is
	 expecting a pair object and I was inserting a string object, once I
	 realized this, I created a pair object e.

February 19th:
         program is running perfectly with simple strings with no special
         characters updating counts, inserting correctly now moving onto
         cleanup.cpp

February 20th:
         I began by making if statments for each case and realized that
         this is the wrong way to go about it. I deleted everything after 4
         hours of testing and will try again tomorrow.

February 21st:
	 Okay thought about cleanup and decieded to create one big if statment
	 that only accepts the characters if encountered per the cleanup.rulz
	 instructions.  This worked great to get rid of leading junk and now all
	 that was less was several special cases.  played with special cases
	 until I could match the outputs of cleanup.eg.out.  Next I checked to
	 see how big.txt would be read through and found that it took an
	 extremly long time on my program to run (approx 5min).  After a DB post
	 Dr.Lacher clued me in that I was using sequential serach to insert into
	 the set and this was circumventing the conviences of a set.  

February 22nd:
	 Repaced entire insert and compare with a simple if else statment that
	 uses the Retrieve() api.  Was super simple and wish I knew about it a
	 week ago.  Works just like ws_i.x
