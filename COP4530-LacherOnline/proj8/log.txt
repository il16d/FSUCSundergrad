April 18th:
      Coppied all files over neccessary for project 

April 19th: 
      built moviematch.h with definition and implmentations, left all
      implmentations blank unless returning values if so gave them dummy values
      just so that I was able to compile and build kb.x even though there is no
      logic and it is unable to run it provides me with a nice clean start all
      ready for implmentations.  Started adding implmentatins of Load() it is
      very similar to wordsmith reading in the movies and actors incrementing
      the counters and first checking to see if it exsits before inserting into
      vector.  making sure to call line() on every incoming movie and actor.
      Than Hash data and call Rehash to setup the hash table.  Finally add the
      verticies and edges for the graph with a call to addEdge()

April 20th :
      Still unclear of the proper implmentation of Init() and how the hint_
      vertex should be processed.  Trying to wrap my head around g_heap_sort and
      using caseInsenstiveLessThanPredicate ad discussed in the disscusion
      board.  Testing load and movie distance with various cout statments and
      much smaller fake movie files.       

April 21st :
      I believe I have my logic correct, the rest of the program is riding on
      the completion of Hint() and Init().  The pseudo code provided in the
      notes is somewhat helpful but I cant seem to figure out he logic will take
      a break and check back in later.

      Update: declared a Iterator and assigned it to g_upper_bound aswell as
      including the proper header file.  This seems to put me on the right track
      as I need to iterate through the hint_ vector.  Still getting a compiler
      error due to my Iterator but the DB posts I am on the right track and
      supplying 4 arguments just cant seem to get the right syntax or proper
      include.... Giving it a rest for the night.         

April 22nd:
      unable to complete any testing due to issue with proccessing g_lower_bound
      I have passed it 4 arguments as required and still screaming error due to
      mismatch type 'const'.  Changed operator() to const fixing the error.
      Still not sure why this was a problem but satisified compiler.

April 23rd:
      Unable to complete final test on autobot due to shell server being down. *update:
      Was able to submit through quake server and have many output diff's due to
      cout statments, and a massive dump of data_[] printing out every vector
      index.  Issue was found in a call to hint_.dump() printing the entire
      vector in every instance of kb.x this was from a test I was doing to check
      the iterator for begin and end.
