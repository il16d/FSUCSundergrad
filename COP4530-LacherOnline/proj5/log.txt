Map_ADT Binary Tree

March 5th, 2017:
      Coppied over all files from proj5 directory aswell as coppied over
      previous wordsmith files for updating for use with maps.

March 6th, 2017
      Spent a couple hours revising oat to become the new Map_adt very tedious
      job to make sure everything was converted properly and new methods,
      classes were coppied over from the project directions properly.  Reviewed
      the project specs and will begin implmenting the new functions this week.

March 8th, 2017
      Built the makefile for testing and attempted to compile as is, resulted in
      20+ errors and will need to check flags.

March 10th, 2017
      Have been stuck on failing to compile due to reference error I cannot
      track down where the issue is coming from my protypes match calls.  In the
      mean time started logic for Decrement, Increment(level order), and
      overloaded operators.

March 12th, 2017
      Still stuck on compile errors keeps complaining about a template
      declaration which does not make sense to me because it matches the same
      declaration of all the other functions.  I am unable to test any logic in
      my functions until the program at least compiles.  Taking a couple days
      off while its spring break and will finish this up over the weekend.

March 18th, 2017
      Spent several hours, posted on the DB I still cannot get a compiliation of
      fmap.x  Reviewed the notes incase I missed something I believe it to be a
      #include issue.

      After another 4 hrs of no luck compiling Dr. Lacher posted on the DB in
      regards to checking const and non-const delcarations.  After all that he
      was right I was mising const versions of Begin,rBegin,End, rEnd once I
      fixed that and added a missing '}' viola it compiled no problem...
      
      On to testing my logic tonight TF traverse worked no problem, so it should
      be no problem to get TR to work its just a miror of TR but it keeps
      looping endlessly...  Moved on to TL traverse and was having a issue due
      to my implmention of levleorderEnd, once I worked the kink out there it
      was traversing just fine
      
      Moved on to updating wordsmith with the iterator version that jumps
      through frequency_ and prints the key and data for each its very similar
      to the first wordsmith which used a iterator to write to a outfile.

      The only thing left was TR traverse which was still looping endlessly.
      After taking a break for a hour and reviewed the logic ONE more time I
      realized what the issue was.  I left a rchild_ condition check and once
      that was changed to lchild_ the loop stoped and the program succesfully
      traversed forward, backward, and on level order.
