COP4530

February 26th:
	 Coppied over all files from proj4 directory into my proj4 directory,
	 aswell as necessary .x files from area51 folder.

February 27th:
	 Createted oaa.h from oaa.begin, created a blank wordsmith2.h and .cpp
	 file built makefile with all objects and executables. Compiled and
	 appended any includes that were necessary in order to compile
	 succusfully

February 28th:
	 Started by locating code provided in notes for oaa.h remaining
	 functions.  Refactored Wordsmith with the new API in order to properly
	 read and write files using Tree's. ran into a couple small issues where
	 counts were off but realized thanks to Dr. Lacher I was using the wront
	 constructor and this fixed my issue.

March 2nd-3rd:
         Completed Wordsmith2.cpp and moved on to oaa.h all functions have been
         implmented and will move on to testing tomorrow.

March 4th:
         Should of used my time wisely earlier in the week, I have spent roughly
         7hrs dealing with a segmentation fault in my RotateLeft conditional
         statment.  Finally found the issue and my if() check for RotateLeft was
         not strict enough and was causing a fault.  The next issue was to check
         for left and right children that were red and convert them to black.
         After project submission there is still a error in my code but I think
         it is in my RInsert() function and will need table.100 to test for all
         possibilites awaiting to where I can find the file for testing.
         Dr. Lacher posted a snipet of code for RGet & RInsert.  updated my code
         in RInsert aswell as Rget(although my Rget was almost identical to his)
         RInsert now works nicely.  Still having issues with Erase() will play
         with it in the morning.

March 5th: 
         Dr. Lacher added the tbl.100 file for testing so I coppied it and
         quickly started to see where my issues were in Erase() it was only
         testing for less than key and not if key was greater than k.  Once this
         was fixed the code is erasing just as it should.
