March 21 2017:
      Coppied files, built makefile with proper targets for all executables as
      instructed in the spec sheet.

March 22nd 2017:
      After reviewing the document and looking over the functions requring my
      implmentations of Insert, Retrieve, Includes, Remove, and operater ++ 
      the assignment appears pritty straight forward and the logic should be
      simple.  But I am trying to figure out what C::method should be called in
      the Insert implmentation currently and exactly what it should return.  I
      keep getting erros in regards to iterators so I must be assigning the
      Includes Iterator wrong.  Will return to this tomorrow.

March 23rd 2017:
      I am still stuck on Insert, and also Includes.  So I figured I would move
      on to Retrieve and Remove. Again I have all the logic in place but I need
      to figure out how to assign the Iterator properly so that I can properly
      iterate through the table and return 1 or 0 in the case of Retrieve or
      actually Remove by value.  Waiting for clarification on the DB.

March 26-28thth 2017:
      Okay issue is due to my Iterator is not Const and also because the
      Iterator must be declared as BucketType::Iterator.  I am still working on
      my logic for Includes and  Retrieve as it seems pretty straight forward
      but I think I am missing some assignment for Iterator i; after it locates
      the key in the table. 

March 31 2017:
      Okay Includes, Retrieve, and Insert are working on the small tests I have
      conducted, I need to figure out Remove as it keeps crashing after it comes
      back from Retrieve.  There must be a pointer error.

      Update, it was coming back from retrieve which is a boolean value but not
      actually finding the location of the key to be deleted.  Once I updated
      the correct pointer location it was properly removing items from the
      vector.  I will do a few more tests tomrrow with some fresh eyes and
      submit for autobot testing.         

April 1st 2017:
      Grade Bot passed all tests except Test3 which had weired results that I
      did not quite understand at first but now it makes sense it was testing my
      Iterator specifically the implmentation of ++ operator of which I had way
      wrong once I walked through the logic on a piece of paper I was able to
      resubmit and pass all tests.  I am not convinced I have a full
      understanding of hashtables after this assignment, as I was just trying to
      get this project to compile and pass tests.  I would love to have a
      detailed lecture that walks through the logic and intricies of the
      subject.  The notes are filled with information but I have not fully
      grasped it and I have read it twice now.
