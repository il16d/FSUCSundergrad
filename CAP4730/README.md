 **To download the projects just unzip the folders!**
 
 ## How do we compile the projets? 
 
 *ALL the projects use Cmake. To compile the programs simply delete the build folders already present by default. On mac, use the comand line to access the folder, then enter the comands:
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake ..
 make*
 ## Once the executables are build simply enter ./(and the name of the executable to run it)
 
Some of the projects I did during my undergrad at FSU, these are used to showcase my skills not for cheating at all, please discuss with your teacher if it is okay for you to borrow this code and make sure you cite it in case that you do decide to use this code so that you avoid academic dishonesty.
