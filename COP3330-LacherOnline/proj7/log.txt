November 15 2015 - Copied all neccessary files over for proj7.

November 16 2015 - began by coding stat.t template file getting the easy 
stuff out of the way and creating the class with the provided constructors, 
destructors and methods.

November 16, 2015 - 6:34pm - Started doing all the easy stuff, created fsu 
namespace, created the template and all of the template constructors, etc... 
just need to code the bodies of the methods and constructors.

Novemeber 17, 2015 - 7pm - coded all of the constructors, and functions.  I 
need to begin testing them tomorrow, I need to figure out what to do with the 
Dump and Display method, I think those are going to be the 2 pain in the butt 
functions.

November 18, 2015 - 5:50pm - stack.t was giving me a heck of a time with a end of non-void function warning.  I finally go to the bottom of it and just needed to 
supply a return option if the loop conditions were not met.  My big issue now is how to implement a generic fsu::Stack. feeling dumb right now.

November 19, 2015 - 7am I have been working on this all day using cout statments trying to find why makefile keeps giving me this compiled error, it doesnt make 
any sense to me.  It's screaming about a my fsu::Stack being out of scope, I have scoured the web searching for similar bugs but cant find any.

November 22, 2015 - A break from coding has done be well, I looked at it again today and noticed the issue kept coming up with my destructor and our class 
instructions were to not implment a destructor which I did not.  The issue was that I didn't put empty {} after my prototype so thats where the issue was coming 
from, what a silly issue and lesson well learned.

November 22, 2015 - deleted a std::endl that I believe was messing up my output ofc.
