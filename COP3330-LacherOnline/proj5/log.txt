October 21st 8:30pm - copied all files to my proj5 dir. and begin 
working on code for tracker.cpp

October 22nd 7pm - struggling with how to read in the array from a data file and instatiate new objects, 
obviously using new is the key but we need to create a new object with each array element and than cout in 
table, sleeping onit.

October 23rd 9am - sleep did me well, we created the do while loop to loop through a switch a statment and 
read in each element with a counter.  A pointer pointing to the new object to be created.  Now this table 
spacing is a nightmare!

October 25th 8:12pm - I CANNOT FIGURE OUT THIS SPACING IV READ THE DISSCUSON BOARD AND IT IS JUST AGRIVATING 
ME.  I know this is a simple fix but I cant figure it out.  I am just going to submit what I have and 
hopefully tomorrow I can get to the bottom of it.

October 26th 5:20pm - Finally figured out the setwidth settings to properly fit the table.

October 27th 7:10am - segment_wide.data was a pain trying to figure out the table.  My problem all along was the DOT and SerialNumber would not revert back to the origonal size of C5 & C6.  So I simply 
did a reset outside of the for loop and bam it worked! =)
