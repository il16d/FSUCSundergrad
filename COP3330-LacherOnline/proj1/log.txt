log.txt # log file for UIntSet project


August 25th, 3:30pm - copied and created neccessary files to begin project.

August 27th, 9:00am - Began coding main.cpp with cout statments and for loops
for input and output of array.  Struggling to figure out how to stop the cin of
array elements when the max size is set to 100.

August 28th, 8:00am - coded header file and stats.cpp file.  Having issues with
the sort and median algorithms.

August 28th, 10:00pm - figured out the proper cin syntax and the sort function.

August 28th, 11:00pm - Irritated because my program will not print out all of
the cout statments.

August 31st, 12:15pm - Been testing for hours I cannot get my program to
complete all of the cout statments, posted disscusion board inquiries awaiting
some feedback.

September 1st, 11:00pm - After strugglng with my cout statments I finally got it
working but not sure what was causing it just found a hack to force it to print
to the console. 

September 5th, 10:00am - Version 1.8 the sort function would not always sort all
integers in the array.  after testing the code several times I discovered the
swap call was placed inside the inner loop of the sort function which would
cause the function not to swap the integers when it was done with the inner
loop.  I also removed all the counter - 1 from loops to allivate any off by one
errors.  My workaround was to inatialize counter as -1 instead of 0.  After
further testing it appears my program is running as inteded with no errors or flaws.

September 9th, 8:30pm - Reviewed testing e-mail and there were 4 warnings in
regards to comparing a unsigned int to int.  I fixed this issue by changing
those ints to unsigned ints.  When I test my code I do not recieve any warnings.
