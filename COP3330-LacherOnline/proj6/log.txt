stats.t Log.txt

October 31st 2015 7am-1pm - This whole long file was recreated from memory.  Last night October 30th around 8pm I was trying to clean up some extra files that were 
created 
by mistake somehow the make file created about 40 files called data1.data.correct and data1.data.incorrect, so I used a command rm -r .correct  It deleted allllll 
of my files in proj6 folder.  I spent all this morning recreating everything and I believe it to now be a working program.  What a morning.

October 27th 2015 - Copied over all files from proj6 folder.  Began by copying code from proj1 stats.cpp file into my template file and than editing code to match 
template format.

October 28th 2015 7pm - I believe my sort function is coded properly, its a bit tricky in typename template format but I need to finish creating 19 .cpp files to 
begin testing.

OCtober 29th 2015 8am - OK just finshied creating 19.cpp files and getting 4 errors on my stats.t file it appears I have a mistake in my loop algorithm of my sort 
function. 

OCtober 30th 2015 6:30pm - WOw my probelm all along was a typo in the swap function of my sort algorithm I spent about an hour trying to fix my algorithm and all 
along it was a typo. errrrh.  Now just to tweak it a little and clean up some extra files.
