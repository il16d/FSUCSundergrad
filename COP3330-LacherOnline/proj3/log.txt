log.txt # log file for UIntSet project


September 29th, 7:31 am - copied all files to my proj3 dir

September 30th, 7:10 pm - complteted header file and working on uintset.cpp file.  I am struggling trying to 
figure out how to use a variable without being alowed to declare any additional privat variables.

October 3rd, 5pm -  Not sure what I was thinking 
there is a predfined variable size_t in the header 
file.  I guess I needed some fresh eyes.  Now If I 
can just figure out how to properly use the bv_ 
class I can figure out the last few member 
functions and start testing.

October 4th, 8:30am - Fresh eyes cures all.  
clearly bv_(function call is the correct syntax).  
Just need to fix a couple errors and warnings. and 
we should be good.

October 6th, 5:30pm - fixed errors and warnings my 
program is compiling and giving same output as the 
test files we are all good.  Just need to do some 
code editing for readability and make sure 
everything is perfect.

October 7th, 2015 - found a missing space in my ostream member function.  I inserted a " " and now the file is 
identical to the provided test file.
