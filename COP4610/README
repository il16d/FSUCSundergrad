Makefile: file used to compile program

Makefile: The makefile compiles the program into an executable. 
          To run the make file, type in the make command within the directory in which the .c file and makefile are stored. 
          This should create the executable for the program.

Bugs:
Currently the sections outlined in the project description as part 4, 5, and 10 are incomplete within our program.
The shortcuts "~", ".", and ".." are not being recognized.
Alias is creating a segmentation fault. This occurs when attempting to compile.
